### What I learned

I learned how to use responsive menus. My God, it was a lot of work to get them working on mobile, but I did it. I'm not 100% happy with the performance, but for my first time, I did pretty well. I also learned how to create a single line; it might seem simple, but for me, it was extremely complicated. And dealing with Git was a nightmare, but it worked. 

### Useful resources

I only used help from devchallenge.io website.

### Built with

Semantic HTML5 markup
CSS





## Features

I didn't use any, I think... 

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges-dashboard) challenge.
